        <h1>Web Development</h1>
        <p>Web development is the process of creating, building, and maintaining websites and web applications that run on the internet. It involves various tasks like designing the user interface (how a website looks), coding the functionality (how a website works), and ensuring the website operates efficiently and securely.</p>
         <p>1. In real life, web development plays a crucial role in almost every aspect of modern life. Here are a few examples of its applications:</p> 
            
        <p>2. E-Commerce: Online shopping platforms like Amazon or Flipkart rely on web development to create user-friendly websites where customers can browse and purchase products.</p>
            
        <p>3. Education: Websites for online learning platforms like Coursera or edX help people access educational resources from anywhere in the world.</p>
        
        <p>4. Communication: Social media platforms (e.g., Facebook, Instagram) and email services are all products of web development</p>
            
        <p>5. Healthcare: Many hospitals and clinics have websites or web portals where patients can book appointments, access medical records, or consult doctors online.</p>
            
        <p>6. Entertainment: Streaming services like Netflix and YouTube are examples of web development enabling access to movies, music, and videos.</p>
